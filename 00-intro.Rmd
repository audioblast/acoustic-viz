While Murray Schafer's _Tuning of the World_ [@schafer1977] inspired many soundscape scientists, this view is of an earlier time, where the concept of multiple simultaneous streams of acoustic data being processed by a single individual was still an idea over the horizon. Individual sounds could be isolated and studied (as today they still are by bioacousticians interested in the behaviour of individual species). The scale of many contemporary ecoacoustics projects precludes an individual from listening to every minute that is recorded, this task no longer being delegated to students but machines.
