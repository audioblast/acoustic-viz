## Descriptive acoustics

### Phonemes and onomatopoeia

### Musical notation
Typical musical notation shows broad similarities with a typical audio visualisation familiar to all bioacousticians and ecoacousticians - the frequency against time plot. Time proceeds in a strictly linear fashion from left to right, and frequency is represented rising from bottom to top.

## Analytic acoustics

### The 'big-three'

#### Amplitude vs Time

#### Ampltiude vs Frequency

#### Frequency vs Time
