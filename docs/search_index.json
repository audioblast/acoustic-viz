These cycles bring regular fluctuations in light levels, day lengths, temperatures, and a host of other influences. Often these cycles interact, with the dawn chorus peaking in the early daylight hours, and itâ€™s timing and intensity fluctuating on a yearly cycle. This chapter looks at visualising these cycles, and additionally the effects of lunar cycles. These plots are created using the SonicScrewdriver package (Baker 2021) which in turn uses the suncalc package (Thieurmel and Elmarhraoui 2019) to perform the required sun and moon position calculations. library(sonicscrewdriver) 7.1 Daily Cycles The use of the term diel for daily cycles has been contested by Broughton (1963) as being an incorrectly formed unnecessary neologism, it sees greater use (according to the online Oxford English Dictionary) than his suggested nycthemeral. The design for these plots came from a desire to compare the dawn chorus at various locations around the UK, although they also offer great potential for comparing locations with greater longitudinal and/or latitudinal separation. The plots show the times of day, night, twilight (7.1.1), sunrise, sunset, nadir and solar noon. The day part of the plot shows the altitude (angle of the sun above the horizon) throughout the day, with the maximum value representing the sun being directly overhead. 7.1.1 The Types of Twilight 7.1.1.1 Civil Twilight 7.1.1.2 Nautical Twilight 7.1.1.3 Astronomical Twilight 7.1.2 Diel Plots As the times of the solar day are dependent both on the date and location these must be passed to the dielPlot() function. dielPlot(&quot;2022-08-08&quot;, lat=53, lon=0.1) Figure 7.1: Example of a diel plot 7.1.2.1 Alternate forms 7.2 Yearly Cycles 7.3 Lunar Cycles 7.4 Interactive Plots These plots can be used to create Shiny apps shiny-diel is an example that shows diel plots for a number of locations, and can be animated using the play button under the date slider.
