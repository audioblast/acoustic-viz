Despite the focus on sound, much of the communication of ideas, and even sounds, between researchers is done using graphical representations. This should not come as a surprise, the printing press came centuries before the radio as a means for long distance communication, and ink on paper has a permanence that sounds would not achieve for a long time after the invention of writing. The current flourishing of these disciplines is driven as much by the low cost and ease of use of products such as AudioMoth and the decreasing cost of digitial storage and processing as by novel ideas. Visualizations of acoustic data however are not going away - we are a predominantly visual species, and as ways of summarising acoustic data - or making the ultrasound tangible, they are powerful tools in the hands of the acoustician. "],["intro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Basic acoustic terminology 1.2 Types of files", " Chapter 1 Introduction “…while we take it for granted that sounds may be described visually, the convention is recent, is by no means universal and, as I will show, is in many ways dangerous and inappropriate.” — Schafer (1977) While Murray Schafer’s Tuning of the World (Schafer 1977) inspired many soundscape scientists, this view is of an earlier time, where the concept of multiple simultaneous streams of acoustic data being processed by a single individual was still an idea beyond the horizon. Individual sounds could be isolated and studied (as today they still are by bioacousticians interested in the behaviour of individual species). The scale of many contemporary ecoacoustics projects precludes an individual from listening to every minute that is recorded, the task no longer delegated to students but networks of machines. Additionally, it is now useful to distinguish between two concepts that Schafer bought together under the concept of notation. Schafer used this term to bring together what is more typically known as notation – phonetics and musical notation – alongside visual representations of the physical properties of acoustic waves (amplitude, frequency, etc). Historically both musical notation and phonemes have been used to describe the songs of various animals, however these methods do not scale to the entirety of the biological soundscape. There is after all, a great deal of the soundscape that is beyond the limits of human hearing, the infrasound, the ultrasound, and the quiet. All manner of information is gathered and shared by other species beyond the limits of our perception, and visualisation is the main tool by which we are able to interpret the entire soundscape. For all species that share it. 1.1 Basic acoustic terminology 1.2 Types of files 1.2.1 Waveform files 1.2.2 zero-crossing References "],["history.html", "Chapter 2 History 2.1 Descriptive acoustics 2.2 Analytic acoustics", " Chapter 2 History 2.1 Descriptive acoustics 2.1.1 Phonemes and onomatopoeia 2.1.2 Musical notation Typical musical notation shows broad similarities with a typical audio visualisation familiar to all bioacousticians and ecoacousticians - the frequency against time plot.

These cycles bring regular fluctuations in light levels, day lengths, temperatures, and a host of other influences. Often these cycles interact, with the dawn chorus peaking in the early daylight hours, and it’s timing and intensity fluctuating on a yearly cycle. This chapter looks at visualising these cycles, and additionally the effects of lunar cycles. These plots are created using the SonicScrewdriver package (E. Baker 2021) which in turn uses the suncalc package (Thieurmel and Elmarhraoui 2019) to perform the required sun and moon position calculations. The Plotrix package (Lemon 2006) is used for creating the visualisation. These packages can be installed as shown below. install.packages(c(&quot;plotrix&quot;, &quot;sonicscrewdriver&quot;)) The SonicScrewdriver package must be loaded before constructing a visual. library(sonicscrewdriver) 7.1 Daily Cycles The use of the term diel for daily cycles has been contested by Broughton (1963) as being an incorrectly formed unnecessary neologism, it sees greater use (according to the online Oxford English Dictionary) than his suggested nycthemeral. The design for these plots came from a desire to compare the dawn chorus at various locations around the UK, although they also offer great potential for comparing locations with greater longitudinal and/or latitudinal separation. The plots show the times of day, night, twilight (7.1.1), sunrise, sunset, nadir and solar noon. The day part of the plot shows the altitude (angle of the sun above the horizon) throughout the day, with the maximum value representing the sun being directly overhead. 7.1.1 The Types of Twilight Figure 7.1: Different types of twilight as the sun sets below the horizon 7.1.1.1 Civil Twilight Civil twilight occurs when the geometric centre of the sun (as seen from Earth) passes between 0° and 6° below the horizon. During this time it is normal for humans not to need the assistance of artifical light for everyday tasks. 7.1.1.2 Nautical Twilight Nautical twilight occurs when the sun is between 6° and 12° below the horizon. During this time there is sufficient light to distinguish the horizon even without illumination from the moon (allowing determination of position at sea through star sightings). 7.1.1.3 Astronomical Twilight When the sun is between 12° and 18° below the horizon many astronomical observations are possible even though some light from the sun is visible through the atmosphere. In urban areas with light pollution this is often considered to be a dark sky. 7.1.2 Diel Plots As the times of the solar day are dependent both on the date and location these must be passed to the dielPlot() function. dielPlot(&quot;2022-08-08&quot;, lat=53, lon=0.1) Figure 7.2: Example of a diel plot 7.1.2.1 Customising a dielPlot() In addition to the date, lat and lon parameters to dielPlot() it is possible to make additional customisations to how the information is presented. Legend A legend can be added to the plot by setting legend=TRUE. dielPlot(&quot;2022-08-08&quot;, lat=53, lon=0.1, legend=TRUE) Figure 7.3: Example adding a legend to a diel plot Plotting Components The components that can be plotted are listed below. By default all are plotted except for Solar Noon and Nadir. Name Notes Astronomical Twilight Nautical Twilight Civil Twilight Sunrise Solar Noon The time when the sun is highest in the sky Sunset Nadir The components that are plotted can be specified using the plot parameter. components &lt;- c(&quot;Sunrise&quot;, &quot;Sunset&quot;, &quot;Solar Noon&quot;, &quot;Nadir&quot;) dielPlot(&quot;2022-08-08&quot;, lat=53, lon=0.1, plot=components) Figure 7.4: Example adding a legend to a diel plot 7.2 Yearly Cycles The yearlyPlot() function from the SonicScrewdriver package shows daylight changes throughout a year. It behaves in a very similar fashion to dielPlot but takes a single year rather a date as input. yearlyPlot(2022, lat=53, lon=0.1) Figure 7.5: Example of a yearly plot 7.3 Lunar Cycles 7.4 Core and ring plots These visualisations for cyclical data plot their information onto a circle with radius of two units. It is possible to limit the plot either to the centre of the circle (a ‘core’ plot) or to the edge (a ‘ring plot’). These alternative forms may be more useful when these plots are used to visualise addition variables (7.7). dielPlot(&quot;2022-08-08&quot;, lat=53, lon=0.1, limits=c(0,1)) Figure 7.6: A ‘core’ diel plot. dielPlot(&quot;2022-08-08&quot;, lat=53, lon=0.1, limits=c(1,2)) Figure 7.7: A ‘ring’ diel plot. 7.5 Behind the scenes 7.5.1 radialPolygon() The majority of the plotting performed for cyclical plots in SonicScrewdriver is performed by the radialPolygon() function. This function can be used to plot sectors, annuli, horizon plots and irregular polygons. It is used by the plotting functions such as dielPlot() as well as helper functions such as dielRings() to add data to cyclical plots. For simple use cases, knowledge of the operation of radialPolygon() may not be needed. A number of helper functions cover the most common uses. However, an understanding of how this function works will allow for far greater customisation of cyclical plots than would otherwise be possible. Figure 7.8: Types of radial polygon plot The various types of plots are created by changing the angle and radius parameters to radialPolygon(). radialPolygon(angle1, angle2, radius1, radius2, col) 7.5.1.1 Orientation Unlike traditional polar plots, diel and yearly plots start their periods on the left hand horizontal, and proceed clockwise. This orientation is assumed by radialPolygon(), although it may be modified (e.g. the parameters reverse=FALSE and rot=0 will plot using the standard conventions for polar coordinate systems.) 7.5.1.2 Sectors A sector is a section of a circle defined by two radii and an arc between them. Sectors are used widely in the default settings of dielPlot() to plot the times of night and twilight. emptyDiel() radialPolygon(pi/6, 2*pi/3, 0, 2, col=&quot;red&quot;) Figure 7.9: Plotting a sector Reversing the angle arguments allows the complementary sector to be drawn. emptyDiel() radialPolygon(2*pi/3, pi/6, 0, 2, col=&quot;blue&quot;) Figure 7.10: Plotting a sector 7.5.1.3 Annuli An annulus is the region between two concentric circles. Annuli and annular sectors are generated by radialPolygon() when the parameter radius is greater than zero. emptyDiel() radialPolygon(0, 2*pi, 1.75, 2, col=&quot;blue&quot;) radialPolygon(pi, 4*pi/3, 1, 1.5, col=&quot;red&quot;) legend( -3,2.5, c(&quot;annulus&quot;, &quot;annuluar sector&quot;), col=c(&quot;blue&quot;, &quot;red&quot;), lty=1, lwd=5, bty = &quot;n&quot;, cex = 1) Figure 7.11: Plotting an annulus and an annular sector 7.5.1.4 Horizons Horizons have one circular edge, and one that represents data, they are named as they often resemble a landscape or cityscape horizon. The example below uses a generated sine pattern to form the data edge. library(tuneR) angles &lt;- (0:200)*pi/200 + pi/2 values &lt;- 0.05*sine(10, samp.rate=201)@left emptyDiel() radialPolygon(NA,angles,0.5,1+values) Figure 7.12: Plotting a horizon polygon. Setting the first angle parameter to NA uses the range of the second to calculate the inner edge. The inner edge can be used to show data by swapping the order of the angle and radius parameters. library(tuneR) angles &lt;- (0:200)*pi/200 + pi/2 values &lt;- 0.05*sine(10, samp.rate=201)@left emptyDiel() radialPolygon(angles,NA,1+values,2) Figure 7.13: Plotting a horizon polygon. The yearlyPlot() function uses two horizon plots, with a shared data edge. 7.5.1.5 Polygons 7.6 Empty plots The uses of daily and yearly plots extend beyond linking data to earthly cycles. The following functions provide the basic coordinate system without any data plotted (these functions are used intenally by dielPlot() and yearlyPlot() to establish their coordinate system). 7.6.1 emptyDiel() emptyDiel() Figure 7.14: An empty dielPlot(). 7.6.2 emptyYearly() The emptyYearly() function takes an option year parameter that automatically adjusts the grid positions for leap years, although the visual effect is marginal. emptyYearly(year=2000) Figure 7.15: An empty yearlyPlot(). 7.7 Adding data to the visualisation 7.7.1 Periodic data: rings The ring functions (dielRing(),…) plot ring segments on top of a base cyclical plot. These rings are useful for showing typical periods of activity for a species, or events that happen continuously for a specified period of time. By defaults the limits for the rings are 1,2 for use with a core type plot, but this can be changed by specifying the limits parameter to the ring function. Similarly, the plot legend may be removed with the paramater legend=FALSE. 7.7.1.1 dielRings() names &lt;- c(&quot;activity 1&quot;, &quot;activity 2&quot;, &quot;activity 3&quot;) starts &lt;- c(&quot;0600&quot;, &quot;0900&quot;, &quot;1500&quot;) ends &lt;- c(&quot;1200&quot;, &quot;1700&quot;, &quot;1900&quot;) cols &lt;- c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;) dielPlot(&quot;2022-08-08&quot;, lat=53, lon=0.1, limits=c(0,1)) dielRings(names, starts, ends, cols=cols) Figure 7.16: A ‘core’ diel plot with diel rings. names &lt;- c(&quot;activity 1&quot;, &quot;activity 2&quot;, &quot;activity 3&quot;) starts &lt;- c(&quot;0600&quot;, &quot;0900&quot;, &quot;1500&quot;) ends &lt;- c(&quot;1200&quot;, &quot;1700&quot;, &quot;1900&quot;) cols &lt;- c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;) dielPlot(&quot;2022-08-08&quot;, lat=53, lon=0.1, limits=c(1,2)) dielRings(names, starts, ends, cols=cols, limits=c(0,1)) Figure 7.17: A ‘ring’ diel plot with diel rings. 7.7.2 Periodic data: horizons In this example we will plot the average monthly minimum and maximum temperatures for Lyme Regis, UK onto a yearlyPlot(). This example introduces two helper functions; yearlyLabels() and circularise(). 7.7.2.1 yearlyLabels() and yearlyPositions These two functions are closely related, and used internally by SonicScrewdriveR to label a yearly plot. yearlyLabels() The optional pos parameter when set to TRUE returns a vector of positions for the labels around the plot (in radians). yearlyPositions(year=2022) ## [1] 0.0000000 0.5336404 1.0156382 1.5492786 2.0657048 2.5993452 3.1157713 ## [8] 3.6494117 4.1830521 4.6994783 5.2331187 5.7495449 The temperature data we have for Lyme Regis is monthly, however we would like to plot the values at the middle of the respective month.
