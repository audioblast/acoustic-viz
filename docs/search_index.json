Despite the focus on sound, much of the communication of ideas, and even sounds, between researchers is done using graphical representations. This should not come as a surprise, the printing press came centuries before the radio as a means for long distance communication, and ink on paper has a permanence that sounds would not achieve for a long time after the invention of writing. The current flourishing of these disciplines is driven as much by the low cost and ease of use of products such as AudioMoth and the decreasing cost of digitial storage and processing as by novel ideas. Visualizations of acoustic data however are not going away - we are a predominantly visual species, and as ways of summarising acoustic data - or making the ultrasound tangible, they are powerful tools in the hands of the acoustician.

Individual sounds could be isolated and studied (as today they still are by bioacousticians interested in the behaviour of individual species). The scale of many contemporary ecoacoustics projects precludes an individual from listening to every minute that is recorded, the task no longer delegated to students but networks of machines. Additionally, it is now useful to distinguish between two concepts that Schafer bought together under the concept of notation. Schafer used this term to bring together what is more typically known as notation – phonetics and musical notation – alongside visual representations of the physical properties of acoustic waves (amplitude, frequency, etc). Historically both musical notation and phonemes have been used to describe the songs of various animals, however these methods do not scale to the entirety of the biological soundscape. There is after all, a great deal of the soundscape that is beyond the limits of human hearing, the infrasound, the ultrasound, and the quiet. All manner of information is gathered and shared by other species beyond the limits of our perception, and visualisation is the main tool by which we are able to interpret the entire soundscape. For all species that share it. 1.1 Basic acoustic terminology 1.2 Types of files 1.2.1 Waveform files 1.2.2 zero-crossing References "],["history.html", "Chapter 2 History 2.1 Descriptive acoustics 2.2 Analytic acoustics", " Chapter 2 History 2.1 Descriptive acoustics 2.1.1 Phonemes and onomatopoeia 2.1.2 Musical notation Typical musical notation shows broad similarities with a typical audio visualisation familiar to all bioacousticians and ecoacousticians - the frequency against time plot.

These cycles bring regular fluctuations in light levels, day lengths, temperatures, and a host of other influences. Often these cycles interact, with the dawn chorus peaking in the early daylight hours, and it’s timing and intensity fluctuating on a yearly cycle. This chapter looks at visualising these cycles, and additionally the effects of lunar cycles. These plots are created using the SonicScrewdriver package (E. Baker 2021) which in turn uses the suncalc package (Thieurmel and Elmarhraoui 2019) to perform the required sun and moon position calculations. The Plotrix package (Lemon 2006) is used for creating the visualisation. These packages can be installed as shown below. install.packages(c(&quot;plotrix&quot;, &quot;sonicscrewdriver&quot;)) The SonicScrewdriver package must be loaded before constructing a visual. library(sonicscrewdriver) 7.1 Daily Cycles The use of the term diel for daily cycles has been contested by Broughton (1963) as being an incorrectly formed unnecessary neologism, it sees greater use (according to the online Oxford English Dictionary) than his suggested nycthemeral. The design for these plots came from a desire to compare the dawn chorus at various locations around the UK, although they also offer great potential for comparing locations with greater longitudinal and/or latitudinal separation. The plots show the times of day, night, twilight (7.1.1), sunrise, sunset, nadir and solar noon. The day part of the plot shows the altitude (angle of the sun above the horizon) throughout the day, with the maximum value representing the sun being directly overhead. 7.1.1 The Types of Twilight Figure 7.1: Different types of twilight as the sun sets below the horizon 7.1.1.1 Civil Twilight Civil twilight occurs when the geometric centre of the sun (as seen from Earth) passes between 0° and 6° below the horizon. During this time it is normal for humans not to need the assistance of artifical light for everyday tasks. 7.1.1.2 Nautical Twilight Nautical twilight occurs when the sun is between 6° and 12° below the horizon. During this time there is sufficient light to distinguish the horizon even without illumination from the moon (allowing determination of position at sea through star sightings). 7.1.1.3 Astronomical Twilight When the sun is between 12° and 18° below the horizon many astronomical observations are possible even though some light from the sun is visible through the atmosphere. In urban areas with light pollution this is often considered to be a dark sky. 7.1.2 Diel Plots As the times of the solar day are dependent both on the date and location these must be passed to the dielPlot() function. dielPlot(&quot;2022-08-08&quot;, lat=53, lon=0.1) Figure 7.2: Example of a diel plot 7.1.2.1 Customising a dielPlot() In addition to the date, lat and lon parameters to dielPlot() it is possible to make additional customisations to how the information is presented. Legend A legend can be added to the plot by setting legend=TRUE. dielPlot(&quot;2022-08-08&quot;, lat=53, lon=0.1, legend=TRUE) Figure 7.3: Example adding a legend to a diel plot Plotting Components The components that can be plotted are listed below. By default all are plotted except for Solar Noon and Nadir.

It is possible to limit the plot either to the centre of the circle (a ‘core’ plot) or to the edge (a ‘ring plot’). These alternative forms may be more useful when these plots are used to visualise addition variables (7.5). dielPlot(&quot;2022-08-08&quot;, lat=53, lon=0.1, limits=c(0,1)) Figure 7.5: A ‘core’ diel plot. dielPlot(&quot;2022-08-08&quot;, lat=53, lon=0.1, limits=c(1,2)) Figure 7.6: A ‘ring’ diel plot. 7.5 Adding data to the visualisation 7.6 Interactive Plots These plots can be used to create Shiny apps shiny-diel is an example that shows diel plots for a number of locations, and can be animated using the play button under the date slider.
