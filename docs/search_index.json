Despite focusing on sound, much of the sharing of ideas between researchers uses graphical representations of some audio features. The use of visual aids should not come as a surprise; the printing press came centuries before the radio as a means of long-distance communication. Ink on paper has a permanence that sounds would not achieve for a long time after the invention of writing. The current flourishing of acoustic disciplines is driven as much by the low cost and ease of use of products such as AudioMoth and the decreasing cost of digital storage and processing as by novel ideas. Visualizations of acoustic data, however, are not going away. We are a predominantly visual species, and as ways of summarising acoustic data - or making the ultrasound tangible, they are powerful tools in the hands of the acoustician.

Individual sounds could be isolated and studied (as today they still are by bioacousticians interested in the behaviour of individual species). The scale of many contemporary ecoacoustics projects precludes an individual from listening to every minute recorded; the task is no longer delegated to students but to networks of machines. Additionally, it is now helpful to distinguish between two concepts that Schafer bought together under the concept of notation. That is to separate notation (phonetics and musical notation) from visual representations of the physical properties of acoustic waves (e.g. amplitude, frequency). Historically, researchers used musical notation and phonemes to describe the songs of various animals. However, these methods do not scale to the entirety of the natural soundscape. Parts of the soundscape are beyond the limits of human hearing; the infrasound, the ultrasound, and the quiet. All manner of information is gathered and shared by other species beyond the limits of our perception. Visualisation is the primary tool by which we can interpret the entire soundscape for all species that share it. 1.1 Predominance of the visual 1.2 Basic acoustic terminology 1.3 Types of files Even though the costs of digital storage have fallen significantly (Figure 1.1), the cost of file transfer and storage are still significant factors in many acoustics projects. For this reason, it is sometimes necessary to compress the audio file in some way: discarding some data in exchange for cost reductions. Figure 1.1: Storage costs per megabyte over time. Data from https://jcmit.net/diskprice.htm. This process of compression may affect the visualisation of the audio files or even the possible types of visualisation for a given file. 1.3.1 Uncompressed waveform files Waveform files are created by sampling the wave amplitude at a sensor at a constant rate, typically tens of thousands of times per second (Figure 1.2). Figure 1.2: Sampling a waveform. An analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) converts the continuous variations in amplitude into one of the numerous discrete levels that the ADC can represent (Figure 1.3. The number of discrete levels is dependent on the analogue-to-digital converter (ADC); a typical 16-bit depth has \\(2^{16}=65536\\) possible values. Figure 1.3: A sampled waveform with low bit depth (top) and higher bit depth(bottom). 1.3.2 Lossy compression 1.3.3 zero-crossing References "],["history.html", "Chapter 2 History 2.1 Goals of visualisation 2.2 Descriptive acoustics 2.3 Analytic acoustics", " Chapter 2 History 2.1 Goals of visualisation Many tasks require the visualisation of acoustic information. Purely descriptive graphical representations may aim to invoke in the mind the sound represented. These visualisations allow passing knowledge of how something sounds from one mind to another. “I have frequently experimented with graphic notations, and in the course of these experiments it has occurred to me that a new type of artistic experience may be opening up to us, in which musical clements could have revitalized graphic correspondences in such a way that one sensation could be triggered by another to produce synaesthesia - that is, a fusion of two art forms into a unitary experience.” — (Schafer 1975) The decreasing costs of electronic data storage and transmission reduce the need for converting audio into graphical form for financial reasons. However, these trends contribute to an increased abundance and availability of acoustic data. It is usually quicker and easier to scan this large quantity of acoustic information when it is represented visually than by listening to it (Figure 2.1). Figure 2.1: Even for a short file of three minutes duration it is quicker to identify regions of interest visually than by listening. Notably, many current machine learning techniques used in acoustics work upon data previously converted into graphical form. Is this an optimum method, or just a consequence of the Predominance of the Visual? 2.2 Descriptive acoustics 2.2.1 Phonemes and onomatopoeia 2.2.2 Musical notation The standard musical notations show broad similarities with a typical audio visualisation familiar to all bioacousticians and ecoacousticians - the frequency against time plot. Time proceeds in a strictly linear fashion from left to right, and frequency increases from bottom to top. 2.3 Analytic acoustics 2.3.1 The ‘big-three’ 2.3.1.1 Amplitude vs Time 2.3.1.2 Ampltiude vs Frequency 2.3.1.3 Frequency vs Time References "],["early-viz.html", "Chapter 3 Early visualisations - the analogue years 3.1 CRTs 3.2 Print outs", " Chapter 3 Early visualisations - the analogue years 3.1 CRTs 3.2 Print outs "],["static-digital-images.html", "Chapter 4 Static digital images 4.1 The time domain 4.2 The frequency domain", " Chapter 4 Static digital images The three fundamental quantities of sound waves are time, frequency, and amplitude. The most commonly used visualisations of sounds are consequently combinations of these properties. The seewave package (Sueur, Aubin, and Simonis 2008) is the easiest way to produce these plots. We will use the sheep audio sample provided by seewave for the first plots. library(seewave) data(sheep, package=&quot;seewave&quot;) 4.1 The time domain Time domain techniques analyse the recorded waveform directly. Conversion of a waveform to a spectrum of frequencies is a relatively costly computation. Before digital computers, frequency analysis was hard to achieve with the precision and resolution we are accustomed to today. 4.1.1 Oscillograms Digitally sampled audio is a series of amplitude measurements sampled at a regular time interval. The most basic plot we could recreate from a sampled file would be plotting amplitude values against time, a plot known as an oscillogram. Figure 4.1: Plotting a waveform Figure 4.1 shows 50 samples from the sheep audio file plotted using the standard R barplot()function. This representation has the advantage that the individual bars are a visual reminder that we are handling a sampled representation instead of a continuously varying waveform. It is common, however, to create a visual representation closer to that of an actual wave (Figure 4.2 shows how this is achieved using base R functions). Figure 4.2: Plotting a waveform The oscillo() function from seewave handles the labelling of axes for us and is a very convenient solution. Figure 4.3 shows the resulting plot, an oscillogram, for the entire sheep file. Figure 4.3: Oscillogram 4.2 The frequency domain The frequency domain covers analyses in which frequency data are extracted from the sampled waveform, typically using the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm. 4.2.1 Plotting a spectrum A spectrum is a plot of amplitude against frequency.

These cycles bring regular fluctuations in light levels, day lengths, temperatures, and various other influences. Often these cycles interact, with the dawn chorus peaking in the early daylight hours and its timing and intensity fluctuating on a yearly cycle. This chapter looks at visualising these cycles and the effects of lunar cycles. These plots are created using the SonicScrewdriver package (Baker 2021), which uses the suncalc package (Thieurmel and Elmarhraoui 2019) to perform the required sun and moon position calculations. The Plotrix package (Lemon 2006) is used for creating the visualisation. These packages are installed as shown below. install.packages(c(&quot;plotrix&quot;, &quot;sonicscrewdriver&quot;)) The SonicScrewdriver package must be loaded before constructing a visual. library(sonicscrewdriver) 7.1 Daily Cycles Broughton (1963) contests the term diel for daily cycles as an incorrectly formed, unnecessary neologism. However, it sees greater use (according to the online Oxford English Dictionary) than his suggested nycthemeral. The design for these plots came from a desire to compare the dawn chorus at various locations around the UK. However, they also offer great potential for comparing locations with greater longitudinal or latitudinal separation. The plots show the times of day, night, twilight (7.1.1), sunrise, sunset, nadir and solar noon. The day part of the plot shows the altitude (angle of the sun above the horizon) throughout the day, with the maximum value representing the sun directly overhead. 7.1.1 The Types of Twilight Figure 7.1: Different types of twilight as the sun sets below the horizon 7.1.1.1 Civil Twilight Civil twilight occurs when the sun’s geometric centre (as seen from Earth) passes between 0° and 6° below the horizon. During this time, it is normal for humans not to need the assistance of artificial light for everyday tasks. 7.1.1.2 Nautical Twilight Nautical twilight occurs when the sun is between 6° and 12° below the horizon. During this time, there is sufficient light to distinguish the horizon without illumination from the moon (allowing the determination of position at sea through star sightings). 7.1.1.3 Astronomical Twilight Many astronomical observations are possible when the sun is between 12° and 18° below the horizon. Some light from the sun is visible through the atmosphere. Often considered a dark sky in urban areas with light pollution. 7.1.2 Diel Plots As the times of the solar day are dependent both on the date and location these must be passed to the dielPlot() function. dielPlot(&quot;2022-08-08&quot;, lat=53, lon=0.1) Figure 7.2: Example of a diel plot 7.1.2.1 Rotations of a dielPlot() By default the information is plotted in the UTC timezone, so locations in other timezones will have an overall rotation. par(mfrow=c(1,3)) dielPlot(Sys.Date(), lat=53, lon=-50) dielPlot(Sys.Date(), lat=53, lon=-0) dielPlot(Sys.Date(), lat=53, lon=50) Figure 7.3: Diel plots in UTC. Plots can be made in any timezone by using the rot parameter to dielPlot() and the tz() function. par(mfrow=c(1,3)) dielPlot(Sys.Date(), lat=53, lon=-50, rot=tz(3)) dielPlot(Sys.Date(), lat=53, lon=-0, rot=tz(3)) dielPlot(Sys.Date(), lat=53, lon=50, rot=tz(3)) Figure 7.4: The same diel plots in UTC +3 By setting the rot parameter to Solar Noon it is possible to align the plots to solar noon. Notice that this rotates the plot labels. par(mfrow=c(1,3)) dielPlot(Sys.Date(), lat=53, lon=-50, rot=&quot;Solar Noon&quot;) dielPlot(Sys.Date(), lat=53, lon=-0, rot=&quot;Solar Noon&quot;) dielPlot(Sys.Date(), lat=53, lon=50, rot=&quot;Solar Noon&quot;) Figure 7.5: The same diel plots aligned to solar noon 7.1.2.2 Customising a dielPlot() In addition to the date, lat and lon parameters to dielPlot() it is possible to make additional customisations to how the information is presented. Legend A legend can be added to the plot by setting legend=TRUE. dielPlot(&quot;2022-08-08&quot;, lat=53, lon=0.1, legend=TRUE) Figure 7.6: Example adding a legend to a diel plot Plotting Components The components that can be plotted are listed below. By default all are plotted except for Solar Noon and Nadir. Name Notes Astronomical Twilight Nautical Twilight Civil Twilight Sunrise Solar Noon The time when the sun is highest in the sky Sunset Nadir The components that are plotted can be specified using the plot parameter. components &lt;- c(&quot;Sunrise&quot;, &quot;Sunset&quot;, &quot;Solar Noon&quot;, &quot;Nadir&quot;) dielPlot(&quot;2022-08-08&quot;, lat=53, lon=0.1, plot=components) Figure 7.7: Selecting the components to plot 7.2 Yearly Cycles The yearlyPlot() function from the SonicScrewdriver package shows daylight changes throughout a year. It behaves in a very similar fashion to dielPlot but takes a single year rather a date as input. yearlyPlot(2022, lat=53, lon=0.1) Figure 7.8: Example of a yearly plot 7.3 Lunar Cycles 7.4 Core and ring plots These visualisations for cyclical data plot their information onto a circle with a radius of two units. It is possible to limit the plot either to the centre of the circle (a ‘core’ plot) or to the edge (a ‘ring plot’). These alternative forms may be more useful when these plots are used to visualise addition variables (7.7). dielPlot(&quot;2022-08-08&quot;, lat=53, lon=0.1, limits=c(0,1)) Figure 7.9: A ‘core’ diel plot. dielPlot(&quot;2022-08-08&quot;, lat=53, lon=0.1, limits=c(1,2)) Figure 7.10: A ‘ring’ diel plot. 7.5 Behind the scenes 7.5.1 radialPolygon() The radialPolygon() function handles most of the plotting functionality for cyclical data in SonicScrewdriveR. It handles sectors, annuli, horizon plots and irregular polygons. It is used by the plotting functions such as dielPlot() and helper functions such as dielRings() to add data to cyclical plots. For simple use cases, knowledge of the operation of radialPolygon() may not be needed. Several helper functions cover the most common uses. However, understanding how this function works will allow for far greater customisation of cyclical plots than would otherwise be possible. Figure 7.11: Types of radial polygon plot The various types of plots are created by changing the angle and radius parameters to radialPolygon(). radialPolygon(angle1, angle2, radius1, radius2, col) 7.5.1.1 Orientation Unlike traditional polar plots, diel and yearly plots start their periods on the left hand horizontal, and proceed clockwise. This orientation is assumed by radialPolygon(), although it may be modified (e.g. the parameters reverse=FALSE and rot=0 will plot using the standard conventions for polar coordinate systems.) 7.5.1.2 Sectors A sector is a section of a circle defined by two radii and an arc between them. Sectors are used widely in the default settings of dielPlot() to plot the times of night and twilight. emptyDiel() radialPolygon(pi/6, 2*pi/3, 0, 2, col=&quot;red&quot;) Figure 7.12: Plotting a sector Reversing the angle arguments allows the complementary sector to be drawn. emptyDiel() radialPolygon(2*pi/3, pi/6, 0, 2, col=&quot;blue&quot;) Figure 7.13: Plotting a sector 7.5.1.3 Annuli An annulus is the region between two concentric circles. Annuli and annular sectors are generated by radialPolygon() when the parameter radius is greater than zero. emptyDiel() radialPolygon(0, 2*pi, 1.75, 2, col=&quot;blue&quot;) radialPolygon(pi, 4*pi/3, 1, 1.5, col=&quot;red&quot;) legend( -3,2.5, c(&quot;annulus&quot;, &quot;annuluar sector&quot;), col=c(&quot;blue&quot;, &quot;red&quot;), lty=1, lwd=5, bty = &quot;n&quot;, cex = 1) Figure 7.14: Plotting an annulus and an annular sector 7.5.1.4 Horizons Horizons have one circular edge, and one that represents data, they are named as they often resemble a landscape or cityscape horizon. The example below uses a generated sine pattern to form the data edge. library(tuneR) angles &lt;- (0:200)*pi/200 + pi/2 values &lt;- 0.05*sine(10, samp.rate=201)@left emptyDiel() radialPolygon(NA,angles,0.5,1+values) Figure 7.15: Plotting a horizon polygon. Setting the first angle parameter to NA uses the range of the second to calculate the inner edge. The inner edge can be used to show data by swapping the order of the angle and radius parameters. library(tuneR) angles &lt;- (0:200)*pi/200 + pi/2 values &lt;- 0.05*sine(10, samp.rate=201)@left emptyDiel() radialPolygon(angles,NA,1+values,2) Figure 7.16: Plotting a horizon polygon. The yearlyPlot() function uses two horizon plots, with a shared data edge. 7.5.1.5 Polygons 7.6 Empty plots The uses of daily and yearly plots extend beyond linking data to earthly cycles. The following functions provide the basic coordinate system without any data plotted (these functions are used intenally by dielPlot() and yearlyPlot() to establish their coordinate system). 7.6.1 emptyDiel() emptyDiel() Figure 7.17: An empty dielPlot(). 7.6.2 emptyYearly() The emptyYearly() function takes an option year parameter that automatically adjusts the grid positions for leap years, although the visual effect is marginal. emptyYearly(year=2000) Figure 7.18: An empty yearlyPlot(). 7.7 Adding data to the visualisation 7.7.1 Periodic data: rings The ring functions (dielRing(),…) plot ring segments on top of a base cyclical plot. These rings are useful for showing typical periods of activity for a species, or events that happen continuously for a specified period of time. By defaults the limits for the rings are 1,2 for use with a core type plot, but this can be changed by specifying the limits parameter to the ring function. Similarly, the plot legend may be removed with the paramater legend=FALSE. 7.7.1.1 dielRings() names &lt;- c(&quot;activity 1&quot;, &quot;activity 2&quot;, &quot;activity 3&quot;) starts &lt;- c(&quot;0600&quot;, &quot;0900&quot;, &quot;1500&quot;) ends &lt;- c(&quot;1200&quot;, &quot;1700&quot;, &quot;1900&quot;) cols &lt;- c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;) dielPlot(&quot;2022-08-08&quot;, lat=53, lon=0.1, limits=c(0,1)) dielRings(names, starts, ends, cols=cols) Figure 7.19: A ‘core’ diel plot with diel rings. names &lt;- c(&quot;activity 1&quot;, &quot;activity 2&quot;, &quot;activity 3&quot;) starts &lt;- c(&quot;0600&quot;, &quot;0900&quot;, &quot;1500&quot;) ends &lt;- c(&quot;1200&quot;, &quot;1700&quot;, &quot;1900&quot;) cols &lt;- c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;) dielPlot(&quot;2022-08-08&quot;, lat=53, lon=0.1, limits=c(1,2)) dielRings(names, starts, ends, cols=cols, limits=c(0,1)) Figure 7.20: A ‘ring’ diel plot with diel rings. 7.7.2 Periodic data: horizons In this example we will plot the average monthly minimum and maximum temperatures for Lyme Regis, UK onto a yearlyPlot(). This example introduces three small helper functions; yearlyLabels(), yearlyPositions() and circularise(). 7.7.2.1 yearlyLabels() and yearlyPositions These two functions are closely related, and used internally by SonicScrewdriveR to label a yearly plot. yearlyLabels() ## [1] &quot;Jan&quot; &quot;Feb&quot; &quot;Mar&quot; &quot;Apr&quot; &quot;May&quot; &quot;Jun&quot; &quot;Jul&quot; &quot;Aug&quot; &quot;Sep&quot; &quot;Oct&quot; &quot;Nov&quot; &quot;Dec&quot; The related yearlyPositions() gives angular positions for the data around the plot (in radians). yearlyPositions(year=2022) ## [1] 0.0000000 0.5336404 1.0156382 1.5492786 2.0657048 2.5993452 3.1157713 ## [8] 3.6494117 4.1830521 4.6994783 5.2331187 5.7495449 The temperature data we have for Lyme Regis is monthly, however we would like to plot the values at the middle of the respective month.
