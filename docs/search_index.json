The most commonly used visualisations of sounds are consequently combinations of these properties. The seewave package (Sueur, Aubin, and Simonis 2008) is the easiest way to produce these plots, and we will use the sheep audio sample provided by seewave for the first plots. library(seewave) data(sheep, package=&quot;seewave&quot;) 4.1 The time domain The time domain is used to describe acoustic analyses where the recorded waveform is not analysed for frequency. Conversion of a waveform to a spectrum of frequencies is a relatively costly computation and, before digital computers, hard to achieve with the precision and resolution we are accustomed to today. 4.1.1 Oscillograms Digitally sampled audio is a series of amplitude measurements, sampled at a regular time time interval. Given that it now seems natural for time to be expressed on the x axis, increasing towards the right, the most basic plot we could recreate from a sampled file would be plotting amplitude values against time. Figure 4.1: Plotting a waveform Figure 4.1 shows 50 samples from the sheep audio file plotted using the standard R barplot() function. This representation has the advantage that the individual bars ar a visual reminder that we are handling a sampled representation, as opposed to a continuously varying waveform. It is common however to create a visual representation closer to that of an actual wave (Figure @ref(fig:amplitude-lines shows how this is achieved using base R functions). Figure 4.2: Plotting a waveform The oscillo() function from seewave handles the labelling of axes for us, and is a very convenient solution. Figure 4.3 shows the resulting plot, an oscillogram, for the entire sheep file.
